# jadebootstrap-seed
[Jade-Bootstrap-Angular](https://github.com/jump3r34/jadebootstrap-angular-seed.git) boilerplate project for [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) using [Express](http://expressjs.com) middleware

## Quick Start

  The quickest way to get started with this boilerplate is to install the packages first and use the npm script to start the application as shown below:

  Install the packages.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/jump3r34/jadebootstrap-seed.git
$ cd jadebootstrap-seed
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
## Features

  * Bootstrap set as the default UI framework
  * JADE set as the default Template engine
  * Focus on high performance
  * Super-speed development using JADE mixins
  * Angular - Single Directory Started
  * Config file setup

## Custom Configuration

  * In the directory 'config' is the config.js file
  * Edit these variables and import them using require where needed
  * There is also a thirdPartyConfig file as well for third party configurations


## Moving Forward

  * There will likely be a fork of this seed project with angular-material
  * The angular material fork will likely have mongo config and passport as well
  * Please leave comments on what you may need and I will try to get it done
  * This was simply forked from rajasegar and I added to it for angular to help people
  * I know a lot of people could use some help on understanding how to start a MEAN app
  * ''That was the original intent -^^- to help others with a skeleton project''
